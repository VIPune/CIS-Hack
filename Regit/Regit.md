# Privacy Preserving Credit Card Fraud Detection
## Team Regit

We aim to develop a privacy preserving credit card fraud detection system using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Differential Privacy (DP).

## Proposed Features

- Training and evaluating a regression model on encrypted data 
- Neural network trained on differentially private data and evaluated on encrypted data.


## Tech

We use a number of open source projects to work:

- [TenSeal] - A python wrapper for SEAL
- [Opacus] - Framework for differential privacy
- [Pytorch] - Open source ML framework

##Results

We have been able to implement an encrypted Regression model which performs very well, just shaving off 4% acc vs the plaintext model.
