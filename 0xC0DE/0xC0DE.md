## Project Idea

Our Problem Statement is to provide a platform for students of all ages and all different fields to come together and share their intellect in a documented way like their best ppts, project ideas, “study materials”(notes) or even blogs for everyone to learn from.

The Tech Stach we would be using is Node with Firebase on Backend to handle Authentication and User Data. The motivation for this is simple. Most times after finishing major college assignments, be they large projects, blogs or just study notes, we tend to toss them away. While websites like Chegg and all exist to share study notes (not projects) they do so behind a paywall.

Our aim here is to help newer students use these study materials while giving some cash incentive (generated via ad revenue) to the ones sharing these documents at no cost to the viewer.
